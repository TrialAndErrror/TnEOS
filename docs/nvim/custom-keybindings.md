# Custom keybindings

Everything here is defined in `config/nvim/lua/custom/keybindings/` and shows up
in [which-key](which-key.md). `Space` is the leader. Plugin-specific keys are in
each plugin's own page.

## Global (no leader)

| Key | Mode | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Esc` | n | Clear search highlight |
| `Esc Esc` | terminal | Leave terminal mode |
| `Ctrl-h/j/k/l` | n | Focus left/down/up/right window |
| `\` | n | Reveal current file in Neo-tree |
| `]h` / `[h` | n | Next / previous git hunk |

## Space Space and quick finds

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `Space Space` | Buffer list (Telescope) |
| `Space /` | Fuzzy find in the current buffer |
| `Space .` | Yazi at the current file |
| `Space -` | Yazi at the working directory |

## `Space b` Buffers

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `bb` | Switch buffer (Telescope) |
| `bn` / `bp` | Next / previous buffer |
| `bc` | Pick a buffer by letter (BufferLine pick) |
| `bd` | Delete buffer |
| `bo` | Close all other buffers |
| `bs` | Scratch buffer (see below) |

**Scratch buffer** (`Space b s`): a centered floating markdown pad. It is
throwaway and wipes itself on close. `q` or `Esc` closes it.

## `Space c` Code

| Key | Mode | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ca` | n | Code action |
| `cq` | n | Quick fixes only |
| `ci` | n | Organize/add imports (applies immediately) |
| `cr` | n | Rename symbol |
| `cf` | n | Format buffer (via `vim.lsp.buf.format`) |
| `cs` | v | Silicon: screenshot the selection ([silicon.md](silicon.md)) |
| `cbs` | v | Silicon: screenshot to clipboard, with buffer context |
| `cc` | v | **Send `@file:lines` to Claude** in the floating terminal |

`Space c c` in visual mode builds a reference like `@src/app.py:10-25`, opens
terminal 1 (same one as `Space t t`) and runs `claude '<ref>' `. Finish typing
your prompt and press Enter.

| `fRf` | Find remote file |
| `fRg` | Live grep on remote |
| `fRe` | Edit ssh configs |

| `gh` / `gH` | File history (buffer) / repo history |

- `Space q` alone runs `vim.diagnostic.setloclist` if you pause on it.
- Insert `Space` in a keymap table as `<leader>`; both leaders are Space.
