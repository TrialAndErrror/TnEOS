# Neovim quick-start

One page per plugin, in `docs/nvim/`. Open the one you want, skim the tables,
and try the keys. Config lives in `config/nvim/` (based on kickstart.nvim).

`<leader>` and `<localleader>` are both **Space**. Press Space and wait: which-key
pops up a menu of everything available (see [which-key](which-key.md)).

## Top 15 things to remember

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `Space` (wait) | Show the which-key menu |
| `Space Space` | Switch buffers (Telescope) |
| `Space f f` | Find file |
| `Space s g` | Grep the project |
| `Space /` | Fuzzy search in current buffer |
| `\` | Reveal current file in the file tree |
| `Space t t` | Floating terminal |
| `Space g g` | Git status (Neogit) |
| `Space x x` | Diagnostics list (Trouble) |
| `Space l d` | Go to definition |
| `Space c a` | Code action |
| `Space c r` | Rename symbol |
| `Space f s` | Save |
| `Ctrl-h/j/k/l` | Move between windows |
| `Esc` | Clear search highlight |

## Core editor settings worth knowing

- Clipboard is shared with the OS (`unnamedplus`): `y` and `p` use the system clipboard.
- Relative numbers are off by default; toggle with `Space t n`.
- Whitespace is visible (`list` on): tabs show as `» `, trailing spaces as `·`. Toggle with `Space t l`.
- Search is case-insensitive unless you type a capital letter.
- `:s///` previews live in a split as you type (`inccommand=split`).
- Indentation is 2 spaces, tabs expanded (guess-indent may override per file).
- Undo history is persisted (`undofile`), so you can undo after reopening a file.
- Mouse is on: click windows, drag splits, click buffer tabs.
- `scrolloff=10`: the cursor stays 10 lines from the top/bottom edge.
- `confirm` is on: `:q` with unsaved changes asks instead of failing.
- Colorscheme: `miniautumn`. Preview others with `Space s c`.
- In a terminal buffer, `Esc Esc` returns to normal mode.
- Yanked text briefly highlights.

## Gotchas in the current config

- **Overlapping prefixes.** `<leader>f`, `<leader>q` and `<leader>s...` are
  both a menu and (for `f` and `q`) a single mapping. If you press `Space f` and
  pause, the single mapping fires (format buffer; for `Space q`, the diagnostic
  location list). Keep typing the second key without pausing.
- **`Space s s` is defined twice**: Telescope's "select Telescope picker" in
  `init.lua` and live grep in `custom/keybindings/search.lua`. Use `Space s g`
  for live grep; it is unambiguous. Check what's live with `Space s k`.
- **`Space h u`** calls gitsigns `undo_stage_hunk`, which newer gitsigns versions
  removed. If it errors, unstage with `Space h s` on a staged hunk instead.
- **`<C-Up>` in Yazi config** is malformed and does not toggle Yazi; use `:Yazi toggle`.
- The `kickstart.plugins.*` extras (debug, lint, autopairs, indent_line,
  kickstart neo-tree/gitsigns) are commented out in `init.lua`, so none of
  their keymaps exist.
