# Yazi

[yazi.nvim](https://github.com/mikavilpas/yazi.nvim) runs the
[yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io) terminal file manager in a floating window and
opens what you pick in nvim. Requires the `yazi` binary on your PATH.

Config: `config/nvim/lua/custom/plugins/yazi.lua`.

## Opening

| Key / command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `Space .` | Open Yazi at the current file (normal and visual mode) |
| `Space -` | Open Yazi in nvim's working directory |
| `:Yazi` | Same as `Space .` |
| `:Yazi cwd` | Same as `Space -` |
| `:Yazi toggle` | Resume the last Yazi session |

`<C-Up>` is meant to resume the last session but its mapping is malformed in the
config (it has an extra positional entry), so use `:Yazi toggle` instead.

Directories do not open in Yazi automatically (`open_for_directories = false`).
netrw is disabled.
