# Neo-tree

[neo-tree.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim) is a file tree
sidebar. It follows the current buffer (`follow_current_file`) and does not
take over netrw/directory opening (`hijack_netrw_behavior = disabled`).

Config: `config/nvim/lua/custom/plugins/neo-tree.lua`.

## Open and close

| Key / command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `\` | Reveal the current file in the tree (focus it). Press `\` inside the tree to close it |
| `Space t e` | Toggle the tree (`:Neotree toggle`) |
| `q` | Close (in tree) |
| `:Neotree reveal` / `:Neotree toggle` / `:Neotree close` | Same via commands |
| `:Neotree float` | Show as a floating window |
| `:Neotree buffers` | Tree of open buffers |
| `:Neotree git_status` | Tree of changed files |
| `<` / `>` | Cycle between filesystem / buffers / git status sources |

The bufferline offsets itself so tabs don't draw over the tree.
